# FarmSense
An IoT-based smart greenhouse framework to enhance food security and support climate action in Bangladesh.

## Overview  
FarmSense is an IoT-based smart greenhouse system designed to monitor and control environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, CO₂ concentration, and soil moisture. The framework aims to improve food security and support climate action by enabling efficient resource management in agriculture.  

## Features  
-  Real-time monitoring of **temperature and humidity**  
-  **CO₂ concentration estimation** using MQ-135 sensor  
-  Soil moisture detection with **resistive & capacitive sensors**  
-  Wireless data transmission via **ESP8266**  
-  Calibration equations embedded for **accurate sensor readings**  
-  Threshold-based alerts for pollution and soil moisture  

## Repository Structure

## Calibration & Data Acquisition  
- **Temperature (°C):** `T = T_raw`  
- **Humidity (%):** `H = H_raw`  
- **CO₂ (ppm):** `CO2 = 3.2 * (G - 300) + 400`  
- **Soil Moisture (Resistive):** `Moisture_R = (1 - (V - 300)/500) * 100`  
- **Soil Moisture (Capacitive):** `Moisture_C = (1 - (V - 400)/400) * 100`  

All computations are embedded in the ESP8266 firmware for **real-time monitoring**.
